*Yes, finally an image (courtesy of RebelT!), just as promised.*

Welcome to the Hunter's Nightmare show!  
Today, we will be talking about a completely new beast:

***The Shapeshifter***

You might be wondering what it's all about, so here's an **FAQ** for you:

> What, actual progress?

Yes.

> What does it do?

It, well, shapeshifts.

> If it shapeshifts, why isn't it transformed here?

In the image above, it's in its original form, right after spawning.  
It hasn't yet had a chance to shapeshift.

> How do I kill it?

That escalated quickly.  
It's resilient to most forms of damage (yes, your sharpness V diamond sword is pretty much useless),
except for everything made out of *silver*, so get mining.

> Which lunatic came up with this? Was it you?

What? Us? Are you out of your mind? Surely we wouldn't come up with something like this.  
It was the, uhm - the illagers! Yes, the illagers are at fault for this.

> How does it shapeshift?

It obviously stalks the target mob while it slowly turns into it, like a chameleon sitting on a leaf.  
I'm kidding, it just kills them.

> What does this have to do with all the stuff you talked about last time?

It's a secret, we'll give you some time to figure it out.  
*And if you want to discuss this with other people who are just as confused as you are,
why not join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ttsaFnH) and have a proper conversation about the mod there for a change?*

> Can't you just tell us now?

No.

> So this is the end of this post?

Exactly, you got it! Cya next time!
