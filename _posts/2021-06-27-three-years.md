Alright, so for today, there's a small special:
We'll talk about ourselves this time!

You might wonder why we're doing this and there are two answers to this question:  
- The third anniversary of TheBlockBox was this Wednesday, June 23rd!
- I didn't actually code anything because of school, so we needed some kind of filler to make it look like something was done.

Firstly, let's start with some history, shall we?

![Forum post with the title "Modification Idea: Supernatural Entities Mod (SEM) Free to use!"](/assets/images/blog/supernatural_entities_mod.png)

The screenshot above, ladies and gentlemen, is how everything started.  
The story is basically that one day in 2018, I decided that I wanted to learn how to mod Minecraft.  
So, after [understanding the basics](https://youtu.be/kbvPKw0y4Lc),
I wanted to get my hands on a real project and looked around on the Minecraft Forums until I found RebelT's post (shown above).  
I figured this was *the small project* I would code on for a few weeks in order to learn about modding,
certainly it wouldn't become some big project we'd work on for several years, right?  
*I didn't know back then, ok?*  
So, after some technical issues and broken links,
I joined the discord (which has sadly been deleted since) and together with some other people,
we formed "PixelEyeStudios" and started working on [Hunter's Dream](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/huntersdream).

Since then, we've rebranded to "TheBlockBox", built friendships and created four mods,
which have in total received 34,6k downloads.

Besides the small side mods, some renames (including Hunter's Dream to Hunter's Nightmare) and periods of inactivity,
we're basically still working on what we started, which is probably also the reason for why you're reading this:

***Hunter's Nightmare***

And yep, even if it sometimes seems like progress is stagnating,
we're still onto our goal of bringing our ideas for Hunter's Nightmare to life -
even if it'll take a while.

So, thank *you* for the support you've given us over the years,
it's extremely motivating to see that there are people who genuinely enjoy your work!

We'll definitely continue to work on this project for hopefully a long time to come - so bear with us - and bye until next time!
