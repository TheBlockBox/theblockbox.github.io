Welcome to the first blog post on here!

For the future, we're planning to upload more posts regarding TheBlockBox itself
and the mods we are coding.  
The latter will be structured like a devlog and published every second Sunday, if possible.
It will mostly revolve around the mod which is currently being developed the most, although we might
also put updates for some of our smaller mods here.

Anyways, stay tuned and have fun reading!
