title: 1.12.2 and (R)Evolution of Transformations
---
Oh hey, didn't see you there!  
"What is that weird title again. Tim, what is wrong with you?" you wonder?  
Alright, let me explain:

As you can see from the first part, "1.12.2", we've started *working on 1.12.2 again!*  
In fact, [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hunters-nightmare/files/3384842)'s the new version!

Did you fall for it? No? Oh okay, well anyways, it was just a [small bug fix](https://github.com/TheBlockBox/HuntersNightmare/issues/16).  
So yeah, we won't be adding new content to this version anytime soon
(especially since even my IDE refuses to help me).

So now, here comes the more interesting second part:  
***The (R)Evolution of Transformations***

> What is this?

Basically, it's the result of a four hour (yes, you read that right) long discussion RebelT and me had.  
The (R)Evolution of Transformations is a new mechanic regarding, well, transformations and is still sort of a secret,
but we're willing to spoil a few details about it here:  
- Firstly, it's a *Revolution of Transformations* in the sense of being something completely new. I mean, maybe it's not exactly unique, but I don't think anyone has made something similar yet.  
- Secondly, it's an *Evolution of Transformations* since the transformations literally evolve. It's like a funky family tree, but for transformations!  
- Thirdly, it's *extremely cool*, like actually! If you're a creative person, which should apply to most Minecraft players, I promise you'll have plenty of fun with this! And if you don't like fun, you can deactivate it in the config and enjoy the vanilla Hunter's Nightmare experience.

And uh, that's what we did in the last two weeks.  
I know - there is, again, not any fancy visual stuff to show off and we didn't give many details either and everything just seems boring -
but bear with us, I promise that these two weeks of brainstorming will pay out in the end - and if you don't want to believe that, just wait and see.

That's it for this post! And yes, as promised, there will be some picture and concrete features to look at soonâ„¢.  
Bye!
