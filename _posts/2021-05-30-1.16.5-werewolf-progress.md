> Ohh, another blog post! Huh, weird thumbnail, I'm wondering what it'll be about this time...

Hey there, I'm glad you asked!

If you're an "active" member of our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Mpdry7t)
(in quotes because no one is ever writing there, not even about the command from the last post, [smh](https://youtu.be/sv2uIgzS9z0)),
today's thumbnail may have caused some sort of déjà vu in you.  
Yep, I messed up the renderers... [again](https://youtu.be/F_DuKOkTHxw) (btw, who of you weirdos put that video on last.fm???)

*Yep, that's how I massacred poor RebelT's work.*

Well, at least we can be glad that this was the only failure in this week!  
Except for the config. The config was a pain. We don't talk about the config.

So, after [threatening RebelT to give me some advice](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScK7XD1oJY9JFB423AR-FUExIvLWw2KNdU-7uvVDkoOapWs-g/viewform),
I again expanded on the Transformation API.  
*I'd try* not to go into too much detail here,
but since I have nothing else to talk about,
I'll do it either way.

So firstly, I added "TransformationData", which is basically just a glorified compound tag that
uses `fun`ny Kotlin features and took me forever to make, but I assure you, it's quite cool.  
I then allowed transformations to use attribute modifiers
for changing various entity attributes like speed, health, attack damage and armor resistance,
so no potion effects and hacky mixin implementations for those anymore!  
Also shout-out to [Ashley](https://github.com/MsRandom) for telling me about that,
you really saved me from going through that [same struggle once again](https://t1p.de/05qo).  
The rest of what was added to the Transformation API, besides lots of more or less useful comments,
was mostly in preparation for the *werewolf*
(yes, it's not finished yet and will definitely change, such a surprise).  
This includes the now finished infection system,
more methods and support for transforming and untransforming,
safer access of properties like transformation, server and client data and whether an entity is transformed or not.

And in fact, that was really all we did in the last two weeks.  
I know — it was a lot of abstract code and not too many fancy images to look at,
but hey, that's what coding a mod is like.  
Anyways, we'll mostly be concentrating on implementing the werewolf entity for now,
including all its functionality and abilities,
so you'll hopefully be seeing some *more interesting stuff* next time!

Cya!
