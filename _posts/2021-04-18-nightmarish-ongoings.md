Welcome! This here, Ladies and Gentlemen,
is the first of a series of bi-weekly blog posts concerning our biggest mod, Hunter's Nightmare (formerly Hunter's Dream)!

Firstly, to address some speculations which have been floating around recently (I'm looking at you, *Humus*), no, the mod is *not* dead.  
I do admit, we did have some *slight* motivation issues during quarantine so we sadly weren't moving forwards as quickly as we wanted to,
but that's all over now! ... I hope

Well, anyways, we are finished with the basic ideas for the new update which we call "Hunter's Nightmare: Fear the Night".  
We are going to disclose all of the features as soon as they have been implemented
because we might make a lot of ~~unnecessary~~ adjustments during the development process,
so a list would most likely be out of date when the mod is finished.
Another reason is that we also just need something interesting for these posts,
unless you would be fine with reading a bunch of code every two weeks.

However, as we are feeling very generous today, here is the most important information concerning the update:
- It is written in **Kotlin**!  
  "What does this change for me?", I hear you ask.
  Uhm so, not much really, it's either larger file size or an extra dependency.
  But ... coding in Kotlin is much more fun than in Java, so it'll help us with motivation!  
  *Seriously, Kotlin functions are literally `fun`.*
- The mod will be for **Minecraft 1.16**.  
  Why? Well, this is (more or less) a port and 1.16 is currently the most recent stable version,
  so it doesn't really make sense to use anything different.
  You also get the bonus of using the mod in combination with all the new nether features, which I guess is kind of cool.
- It will be written in **Fabric**.  
  In case you want to tell us why we should stick with Forge and how Fabric is evil and will corrupt the mod from the inside,
  make sure to tell us, I just have to get my earplugs real quick.  
  If you want an actual explanation, read [this](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hunters-nightmare#c70).
- The first update will contain **Werewolves** and **Vampires**.  
  This one was really unexpected, I know.

Alright, this was actually it for today's post. (Tragic, I know.)  
In case you still have some unanswered questions, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ttsaFnH) and we'll try to reply as soon as possible.

For more information on the current progress and a few ingame screenshots, be sure to tune in for the next post on May 2nd!

So that's it, bye until next time!
