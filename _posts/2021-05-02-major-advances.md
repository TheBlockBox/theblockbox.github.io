Today, I welcome you to the 2nd edition of our fortnightly blog about our mod Hunter's Nightmare!  
*Well, this sounded a bit weird.*

Alright, so, as promised last time, today we will present to you
all the information you have been craving for the last two weeks:  
*(Unless you are on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ttsaFnH), where we already sent this on Wednesday.)*

Yep, that's what we've accomplished thus far. Great, isn't it?  

Okay, for real now, here's the *actual* progress:  
Firstly, regarding textures and models, they're already finished!  
Thanks to the great RebelT, silver, all plants and the werewolf model and skins,
which will be included in the first version, have been added!  
Codewise, all of that has also been implemented.
(Except for some remaining logic, which depends on other features to be completed.)

Actually, here's a preview:

Other than that, we've also learned more about how Fabric works (including Mixins, which are quite cool)
and finished the important parts of the Transformation API,
which is basically the foundation of werewolves, vampires and all other transformations we might decide to add.
It also allows other mods to add their own transformations to Hunter's Nightmare,
in case people still want that weird werewolf dragon.
*(Please don't actually add this abstrosity though.)*  
Also, speaking of werewolves, we're currently working on implementing them!
As of now, their rendering is close to finished, while transformation on full moon and infection are still under active development.
Of course, this is only our current main focus;
there are still many other great features to come, like the buffs you use to hunt down your poor friends.  
Additionally, we've also worked on improving the config by offering more settings to provide better customization,
which was actually requested quite often due to the lack of options in older versions.
This config stuff might sound boring, but that's only until you notice that the werewolf chance for all entities can be set to 100%.

And well, that's actually all for today!  
It might not seem like much yet, but there is *a lot* more to come.  
*And also writing that Python script for publishing the blog posts on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/ttsaFnH)
might've hindered me from coding the mod a little.*

Now, here comes the sad part again, where we have to say farewell,  
but only until the 16th, when there shall be another post waiting for you!

So therefore, goodbye until next time!
